Methodology
The project involves obtaining historical electricity usage data, preprocessing the data to handle outliers and missing values, and extracting relevant features. Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated, with a focus on performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2).

Implementation and Algorithms
The implementation includes data preprocessing, decision tree, linear regression, random forest, and KNN algorithms. Detailed explanations and code snippets are provided for each algorithm, enhancing understanding and reproducibility.

Experiment Results
Results from experiments, including output visualizations and a comprehensive comparison of performance metrics for different algorithms, are presented.

Conclusion
Accurate power consumption forecasting is crucial for effective energy management. The KNN algorithm emerged as the most suitable choice in this scenario, with an outstanding R2 score of 0.993. Continuous monitoring and updates are emphasized to adapt to changing variables.
