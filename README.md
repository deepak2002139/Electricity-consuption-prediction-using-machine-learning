Abstract
The project focuses on forecasting power usage using machine learning techniques. Traditional methods for predicting power usage have limitations, and advancements in machine learning have enabled more accurate predictions. The report explores various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, K Nearest Neighbours, XGBOOST, random forest, and artificial neural networks, to forecast power usage. The K Nearest Neighbours model demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving a 90.92% accuracy rate for predicting agricultural production.

Introduction
Electricity is becoming the primary energy source for homes, businesses, and transportation. Accurate power consumption forecasting is crucial for optimizing energy distribution and avoiding system overload. The project aims to create a machine learning-based method for forecasting power usage, addressing challenges such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

Theory
The report reviews machine learning techniques for load forecasting, emphasizing their significance in electricity supply management. Various machine learning methods, including decision trees, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and ensemble methods, are discussed.

Methodology
The project involves obtaining historical electricity usage data, preprocessing the data to handle outliers and missing values, and extracting relevant features. Machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and artificial neural networks, are trained and evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2).

Implementation and Algorithms
The implementation includes data preprocessing, decision tree, linear regression, random forest, and K Nearest Neighbors algorithms. Each algorithm is explained, and code snippets are provided for better understanding.

Experiment Results
The results of the experiments, including output visualizations and a comparison of R2 score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for different algorithms, are presented.

Conclusion
Forecasting electricity usage is vital for effective energy management. The K Nearest Neighbors algorithm demonstrated superior performance in this scenario, with an R2 score of 0.993. Continuous monitoring and updates are necessary to adapt to changes in consumer behavior and environmental conditions.
